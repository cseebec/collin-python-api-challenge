## Disclaimer
**The code will not work unless you create accounts at openweathermap.org and googleapis.com and get api_keys. The first cell in each code references api_keys.py which is not included in the repo because if you use api too much it costs money otherwise the api is free to use. For this reason I did not want to post my api key publicly.**

**If you do create accounts at these websites and get api keys the code in this repo will run without any problems**
